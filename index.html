                Welcome to my page! My name is Ben and I am a student at the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. I am new to
                coding, but am extremely excited to push myself throughout the course.
                I grew up in Abington, PA and currently live in the Fairmount area of Philadelphia. I attended the
                University of Pennsylvania and graduated in 2015 as a Cognitive Science Major.
                Before enrolling in this course I spent my time in a few different jobs including with the 76ers
                organization, Northwestern Mutual and as a professional caddie on the Web.com Golf Tour.
                I am pumped for all of the opportunities and new career paths that this course will open up for me!
            </p>
            <p id="p-two">
                Although I am spending a lot of my free time focusing on this course, I am also very passionate about
                the game of golf - I still play a number of tournaments, when my schedule allows.
                While golf is the one sport I spend my time actually playing, I also spend a lot of time watching most
                sports. I have always been, and remain, a huge Philadelphia sports fan. Go Sixers!
                Another thing I am passionate about is pets - there was a brief time I thought about going to veterinary
                school. I spent a summer interning for the Penn Vet Working Dog Center -- in this very Pennovation
                Facility!!
            </p>
            <p id="p-three">
                Well that's enough about me - now I need to focus on the material so I can improve with all of this.
